### Python Tutorial 

Please start by reading the `python_related_requirements.pdf`file and follow the steps to install al the requirements needed for this tutorial. After that, you can watch the videos that are on the Moodle platform and use this scripts to follow along. 

*Note:
- You have both `.html` and `.ipynb` files. If you managed to install jupyter notebook on your computer, we recommend using the `.ipynb` to run the scripts on your machine. Otherwise, just use the `.html` version.
- There is a mistake in the video of the first module when defining variables. There is an x variable that should be 5 instead of 4.
