    "# COBRApy\n",
    "\n",
    "COBRApy is a package for constraint-based modeling of biological networks written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool allows loading and inspecting Genome-Scale Metabolic (GEM) models written in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using COBRApy, one can analyze the following model contents:\n",
    "1. Reactions\n",
    "2. Metabolites\n",
    "3. Genes\n",
    "4. Exchange reactions (Environmental Conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "COBRApy allows manipulating the contents of a GEM model. For instance, one can edit reactions' flux bounds, knock out a metabolic gene, or change environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "COBRApy contains flux analysis methods to simulate an organism's phenotypic behavior. These include Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), Parsimonious FBA, or Flux Variability Analysis (FVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation of gene and reaction deletions for a given GEM model is a straightforward process. One can simulate single or double knockouts using one of the flux analysis methods mentioned above."
