# Summer School in Metabolic Modeling - 2022 edition

## Description
The course will introduce state-of-the-art metabolic modelling covering the full process from model reconstruction to phenotype predictions and analysis. 
The course will focus on metabolic model reconstruction, phenotype simulation, integration with omics data and strain optimization, including both unicellular microbes and more complex organisms, such as plants and humans. 
Applications include metabolic engineering, plant and health sciences.

The following topics will be covered:
- Genome annotation and reconstruction of metabolic models using merlin. 
Check out merlin for more details.

- Flux analysis, phenotype simulation and strain optimization using OptFlux, COBRApy and MEWpy. 
Check out OptFlux, COBRApy, and MEWpy for more details.

- Analysis and integration of omics data and into genome-scale metabolic models, using Troppo. 
Check out Troppo for more details.

- Novel modeling paradigms including protein allocation constraints, transcription/ translation and regulatory interactions, using MEWpy. 
Check out MEWpy for more details.
