# Metabolic Modeling Tutorials

This repository contains a few tutorials on metabolic modeling and strain optimization using MEWpy. 

To run the examples please follow the installation instructions first.

### Installation

To run these tutorials you need a Python 3.6+ environment. If you don't have one already, you can install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Then you need to install a few other packages.

```
pip install mewpy cplex
```

Please note that this will install the free version of [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer), which is limited to the simulation of small models. To install the full version you should obtain an academic license. The exercises can not be run with the community CPLEX.

Additional packages (geckopy, pytfa and ETFL) are installed directly from the notebooks. 

 

### Running the examples

Just start jupyter from a terminal and you will be able to run the exercises in your browser.

```
jupyter notebook
```
